# Seatbelt On! Website

This is the source code for the website of NFT Seatbelt On! originally launched on https://seatbelt-on.com/ (now closed). It is a responsive one-page website that was used to showcase the NFT, count down for the launch of the NFT, and also connect to metamask for minting. It was created using React and can be ran using ```npm start```.

The project can be found on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/seatbelt-on) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oseatbelt?s=11&t=PLKlEa57_vOAcgILg7NImw).
